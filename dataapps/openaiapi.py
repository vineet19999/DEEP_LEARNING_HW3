#ChatCompletionMessage(content="In the realm of code's endless rhyme,\nWhere algorithms weave space and time,\nExists a technique, both simple and grand,\nA poetic dance called recursion, hand in hand.\n\nLike a mirror reflecting its own reflection,\nA function calls itself, a cyclical connection,\nAn elegant loop, with depth and precision,\nUnfolding mysteries in code's pure vision.\n\nWith eyes unclouded, let me explain,\nRecursion's power, in rhythm and refrain.\nImagine a puzzle, disassembled, undone,\nWith recursive steps, it swiftly becomes one.\n\nJust like a Russian doll, nested so fine,\nA function calls itself, time after time.\nA small problem breaks, into fragments untold,\nRevealing a pattern, as it gracefully unfolds.\n\nFor every iteration, a recursive embrace,\nBreaking down the problem, with grace and with grace.\nEach layer peeled back, till a base case is found,\nWhere solutions lie waiting, on solid ground.\n\nLike a fractal's intricate, infinite design,\nRecursion unwraps, the code's mystical shrine.\nA web of self-repetition, reaching to the core,\nUnlocking the secrets, that lie at the code's core.\n\nBut heed this warning, with caution and care,\nRecursion can spiral, wild and unaware.\nWithout a base case, it endlessly twirls,\nA loop without end, in an infinite whirl.\n\nSo tread with awareness, embrace the recursive,\nWith clarity and logic, let your code be cohesive.\nFor recursion, my friend, is a tool to be wield,\nIn the hands of a poet, whose stories shall be revealed.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
