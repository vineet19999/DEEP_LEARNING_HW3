It is much simpler to use Wav2Vec2 without a language model as an end-to-end ASR system and it has been shown that a standalone Wav2Vec2 acoustic model achieves impressive results. For demonstration purposes, we fine-tune the \"base\"-sized [pretrained checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base) on the rather small [Timit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timit_asr) dataset that contains just 5h of training data."

        "Speech is a continuous signal and to be treated by computers, it first has to be discretized, which is usually called **sampling**. The sampling rate hereby plays an important role in that it defines how many data points of the speech signal are measured per second. Therefore, sampling with a higher sampling rate results in a better approximation of the *real* speech signal but also necessitates more values per second.\n",

The same speech signals sampled at two different rates have a very different distribution, *e.g.*, doubling the sampling rate results in data points being twice as long. Thus,\n",

Our fine-tuning dataset, [Timit](hhtps://huggingface.co/datasets/timit_asr), was luckily also sampled with 16kHz. If the fine-tuning dataset would have been sampled with a rate lower or higher than 16kHz, we first would have had to up or downsample the speech signal to match the sampling rate of the data used for pretraining.\n",

        "- `sampling_rate`: The sampling rate at which the model is trained on.\n",

        "- `return_attention_mask`: Whether the model should make use of an `attention_mask` for batched inference. In general, models should **always** make use of the `attention_mask` to mask padded tokens. However, due to a very specific design choice of `Wav2Vec2`'s \"base\" checkpoint, better results are achieved when using no `attention_mask`. This is **not** recommended for other speech models. For more information, one can take a look at [this](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/3227) issue. **Important** If you want to use this notebook to fine-tune [large-lv60](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-lv60), this parameter should be set to `True`."
